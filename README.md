# ML-Algorithim-coded-from-scratch

In this repositry I had tried to code some machine learning algorthime from scratch.This repositry inlucdde following algorhims : - 

# 1. Linear Regression 



In each algothim we have following files. 

**Training.py** : - This File can be use for trainning your model.

**Validate.py** :- This File is use for validating your model with the existing model of sklearn or well known libraries. 

**predict.py** : - this file is use for predicting the values of new data on the basis of the model you had trained. 

**Weights.csv** : - This file stores the weights of the model trained So that they can be use to predict the value of the new data.
