# ML-Algorithim-coded-from-scratch

In this repositry I had tried to code some machine learning algorthime from scratch.This repositry inlucdde following algorhims : - 

# 1. Linear Regression 



In each algothim we have following files. 

**Training.py** : - This File can be use for trainning your model.

**Validate.py** :- This File is use for validating your model with the existing model of sklearn or well known libraries. 

**predict.py** : - this file is use for predicting the values of new data on the basis of the model you had trained. 

**Weights.csv** : - This file stores the weights of the model trained So that they can be use to predict the value of the new data. 


# 2. K nearest Neighbours  

**helper.py**  :- This file contains all the helping function which are needed for the prediction of the data in the KNN algorithim. It contains function for computing the distance between two vectors, finding k neares neighbours some other similar functions. 

More improvement can be dine in this algorithim like here we are comparing the test vector with all the training examples but instead of that we could built somethin likhe Kd trees, local sensitive hashing or Inverted Index So that the number of the comparision could be reduced.
